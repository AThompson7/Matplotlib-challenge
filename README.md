**Analysis**

For mouse weight and average tumour volume the r-squared value is 0.7, this means approximately 70% of the movement in volume can be explained by the movement in weight. This indicates a decently strong positive correlation.

For mouse s185, We can see over time the tumour volume steadily decreases. This could indicate success of the drug regimen for this mouse at reducing tumour size volume. 

Looking at the boxplot we can see there is 1 outlier for the Infubinol drug regimen.

There is a roughly 50/50 split in female vs male mice.
